//describe an infinte loop and how it can occur
//an infinite loop is sequence of  instructions that repeats many times and never reaches a stopping condition
// provide an example of an infinite for loop and explain how to stop it.
// it can occur incase of an incorrect condition
//missing update loop
//for example

  //(i <5);
//print(i)
